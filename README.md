I'm a professional software engineer, working in the weather tech and embedded space, currently obsessed (like about half the world) with rust. I'm a fan of literate programming, and living documentation in general. I've written extensive documentation, training and onboarding guides for many languages and stacks. 

I currently work daily in C/C++ (embedded) and C# dotnet. I write Rust in my free time and as a side gig. In the past, I've worked professionally in Go, PHP, TypeScript, Ruby, Python, Perl, and Java, with a little bit of TCL. I came from a network background -- administering data and voice networks, troubleshooting, deploying changes.

Don't bother contacting me about a job. I'm not looking and this isn't the place.
